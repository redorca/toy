        Deleted Bill.0 and generated a new branch, bill_a, from master.
        Verified the app works and generated data streams and candles.

        TODO: Figure out IO, in particular tainted actors and boxes.

        Pivot back to python to complete Dave's work.

        Discussed process and data flow with Dave.
            * asyncio needs return values to know when an event is done.
            * connect.py handles the netowrk directed acycle graph
            * 

        Observed the following:
            * When the data flow pattern is very choppy likely the market data source
              is closed.

            * Candle events can be used to debug streams and monitor frequency of
              data, moment of data.
