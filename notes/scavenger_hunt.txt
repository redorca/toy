# spi-tools

This package contains some simple command line to help using Linux spidev devices.
  Delete characters using 'x', all characters from the cursor to the end of the line shift+D
  Undelete with shift+U
  Repeat the previous action using '.'
====> Find another instance of the 8th word delete it.

Version 1.0.1

## Content

### `spi-config`

Query or set the SPI configuration (mode, speed, bits per word, etc.)

### `spi-pipe`

Send and receive data simultaneously to and from a SPI device.

  Deleting a character, a word, a line, saves that deletion in a buffer.
  That buffer can then be used to place its contents anywhere in the file.
  So the deleted word above can be put at the end of the line with 'p'.
  To place that deletion before a word use shift+P
====> After the deletion insert that word at the end of the line. Count the number of characters
      of the new word and move backwards to the Nth word where N is the number of characters.

## Installation

First, get the latest version on https://github.com/cpb-/spi-tools.git.
Then enter the directory and execute:

```
$ autoreconf -fim
$ ./configure
$ make
```
 To move the cursor around the screen use shift+L, move to the bottom of the screen,
                                          shift+H, movce to the top of the screen,
                                          shift+M, move to the mniddle of the screen.
                                          shift+$, move to the end of the line
                                          shift+^, move to the first character in a line

===> Jump down a number of lines equal to the position of the first character of the above line.

Then you can run `make install` (probably with `sudo`) to install them and the man pages.

If you have to use a cross-compilation toolchain, add the `--host` option to
the `./configure` command, as in `./configure --host=arm-linux`. This is the
prefix to be inserted before all the toolchain commands (giving for example
`arm-linux-gcc`).

You can use `make uninstall` (with `sudo`) to remove the installed files.

## Usage

### spi-config usage

#### options

* `-d --device=<dev>`  use the given spi-dev character device.
* `-q --query`         print the current configuration.
* `-m --mode=[0-3]`    use the selected spi mode.
* `-l --lsb={0,1}`     LSB first (1) or MSB first (0).
* `-b --bits=[7...]`   bits per word.
* `-s --speed=<int>`   set the speed in Hz.
* `-r --spirdy={0,1}`   set the SPI_READY spi mode flag.
* `-w --wait`          block, keeping the file descriptor open.
* `-h --help`          help screen.
* `-v --version`       display the version number.

#### Read the current configuration

```
$ spi-config -d /dev/spidev0.0 -q
/dev/spidev0.0: mode=0, lsb=0, bits=8, speed=500000
$
```

#### Change the clock frequency and read it again

```
$ spi-config -d /dev/spidev0.0 -s 10000000
$ spi-config -d /dev/spidev0.0 -q
/dev/spidev0.0: mode=0, lsb=0, bits=8, speed=10000000
$
===  Move to the beginning of a word is 'w', ignore punctuation use 'W'
     Move to the end of a word is 'e', ignore punctuation use 'E'

===> Move to line 15 and find the 8th word. ':15 8W"
```

Note: on some platforms, the speed is reset to a default value when the file descriptor is closed.
To avoid this, one can use the `-w` option that keep the file descriptor open. For example:

```
$ spi-config -d /dev/spidev0.0 -s 10000000 -w &
$ PID=$!
```
                         Note Note
                         Move up and down a file using the 'j' and 'k' keys.
                        'j' moves one line down and 'k' moves one line up.

====> Move down 10 lines
And when you don't need the SPI device anymore:

```
$ kill $PID
```

### spi-pipe usage

#### Options
====> Another way to move 10 lines is '10j' or '10k' so move down 50 more lines

* `-d --device=<dev>`    use the given spi-dev character device.
* `-m --mode=[0-3]`      use the selected spi mode.
* `-s --speed=<speed>`   Maximum SPI clock rate (in Hz).
* `-l --lsb={0,1}`       LSB first (1) or MSB first (0).
* `-B --bits=[7...]`     bits per word.
* `-r --spirdy={0,1}`    set the SPI_READY spi mode flag.
* `-b --blocksize=<int>` transfer block size in byte.
* `-n --number=<int>`    number of blocks to transfer.
* `-h --help`            help screen.
* `-v --version`         display the version number.

#### Send and receive simultaneously

Sending data from `command-1` to SPI link and receiving data from SPI link to `command-2`

```
$ command_1 | spi-pipe -d /dev/spidev0.0 | command_2
```

Note that `command_1`, `command_2` and `spi-pipe` run simultaneously in three parallel processes.

#### Send data through the SPI link

```
$ command_1 | spi-pipe -d /dev/spidev0.0
```

#### Receive data from the SPI link

```
$ spi-pipe -d /dev/spidev0.0 < /dev/zero | command_2
```

You can also use `command_2 < /dev/spidev0.0` but with `spi-pipe` you control what is sent to the device (always `0` in this case).

#### Read 40 blocks of 4 bytes from the SPI link
===> go to the line number equivalent to the length of that line:

```
$ spi-pipe -d /dev/spidev0.0 -b 4 -n 40 < /dev/zero | command_2
```

#### Send binary commands through the SPI link

You can use the shell `printf` command to format binary data to send.

For example, to send the bytes sequence 0x01-0x82-0xF3 and see the reply, use:

  Similar to 'j' and 'k' are 'h' and 'l' which move the cursor backwards and forwards on a line.
===> Search for the the text "Read 4"  and find the length of that line.

```
$ printf '\x01\x82\xF3' | spi-pipe -d /dev/spidev0.0 | hexdump -C
```


to search for something the forward slash followed by the keyword, or some portion of it.
E.G. /Note
Search is case sensitive.

===>  Use "" to return to your previous position 
===>  Search for the word: Note
